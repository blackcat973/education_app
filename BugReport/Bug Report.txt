Sometimes, a physic issue is found in which the box is stuck on top and does not fall off. To solve this problem, we used many methods or modified methods, and as a result, we find that the y-coordinate in the box changes to zero if world->step() is invoked. We tried debugging for a few days to solve this problem, but we couldn't stop the coordinates of y from continuously changing to zero, perhaps because of a bug in Box2D.
If you look at the screenshot(bug1 and bug2) attached together (where world->step() runs), you can see that y changes to zero here, where it says island.Solve() on the line 531. But no matter how much we changed the code we made, it didn't work out, so we can't really do anything about that.
If the boxes are stuck on top of the game, close the game and rebuild the code then start again the game.
